SearchSploits.rb
================

Search Tool for easy handling of the Exploit-DB Archive &amp; associated CSV file

Find exploits easily by easy search categories.

Keep up to date by downloading the latest archive when you need it (if existing copy it is kept just in case update fails as they have odd timing settings on their downloads and success is 50/50 when scripting, idk)

You can easily setup manually if download/update not working right
Looks for directory called 'exploit-db', then checks for 'platforms' dir and the files.csv file. If you place them there manually things will work fine.

There are other versions of this already, but I wanted to make one in Ruby :p

Hope its handy for someone...

Enjoy!
